# üõ†Ô∏è Dockerfile and Deployment Fixes

This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve Docker build issues, model loading problems, and Railway deployment failures.

## üîß Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Git LFS Model File Handling** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The `.pkl` model file wasn't properly handled by Git LFS during Docker builds, resulting in incomplete or corrupt files.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added Git LFS installation to both builder and production stages
- Added Git LFS configuration and initialization
- Implemented model file verification with size checks
- Added automatic Git LFS pull attempts if model file is missing/small
- Included `.git` directory and `.gitattributes` in Docker image for LFS support

### 2. **Robust Model Loading** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Model loading would fail silently or cause application crashes when the model file was corrupt or missing.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Enhanced `SMSPredictionService` with multiple model path detection
- Added comprehensive error handling for corrupt pickle files
- Implemented automatic fallback to heuristic-based spam detection
- Added retry mechanisms with cooldown periods
- Improved logging for debugging model loading issues

### 3. **Requirements Optimization** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Large PyTorch dependencies were causing slow builds and timeouts on Railway's free plan.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Switched to CPU-only PyTorch versions for faster downloads
- Pinned specific versions to avoid compatibility issues
- Optimized package selection for production deployment
- Added proper index URLs for CPU-only packages

### 4. **Health Check Enhancement** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Health checks weren't verifying model status, leading to false positive "healthy" responses.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with model status verification
- Added dedicated `/model-status` endpoint for detailed diagnostics
- Implemented graceful degradation (fallback mode still passes health checks)
- Added database connectivity checks (non-blocking)

### 5. **Railway Configuration** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Insufficient timeouts and restart policies were causing deployment failures.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Increased health check timeout to 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Added proper environment variables for model path and Python optimization
- Configured appropriate restart policies
- Added build optimization settings

## üìã Key Files Modified

### `Dockerfile`
- **Multi-stage build optimization** with Git LFS support
- **Model file verification** and automatic recovery
- **Enhanced environment variables** for performance

- **Robust model loading** with multiple path detection
- **Fallback prediction system** using heuristic spam detection
- **Enhanced error handling** with automatic recovery
- **Comprehensive health checks** and model status reporting
- **Git LFS integration** for automatic model file recovery

### `src/main.py`
- **Enhanced health check endpoint** with model verification
- **New model status endpoint** for detailed diagnostics
- **Graceful degradation** handling for model failures
- **Non-blocking database checks** in health endpoint

### `requirements-prod.txt` & `requirements.txt`
- **CPU-optimized PyTorch** for faster builds and smaller images
- **Pinned versions** for reproducible builds
- **Additional utilities** for model handling and requests

### `railway.json`
- **Extended timeouts** (600s health check timeout)
- **Proper environment variables** for production
- **Optimized restart policies** (3 retries instead of 10)
- **Build optimization** settings

### `.dockerignore`
- **Precise inclusion rules** for necessary Git LFS files
- **Optimized exclusions** to reduce build context size

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1. **Pre-deployment Verification**
```bash
# Run the verification script locally
python verify-deployment.py

# Test Docker build locally
docker build -t fraud-detection-test .

# Test the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 fraud-detection-test
```

### 2. **Git LFS Setup** (if not already done)
```bash
# Ensure Git LFS is tracking your model file
git lfs track "*.pkl"
git add .gitattributes
git add phobert_sms_classifier.pkl
git commit -m "Add model file with Git LFS"
git push
```

### 3. **Railway Deployment**
- Push your changes to your repository
- Railway will automatically trigger a new deployment
- Monitor the build logs for any Git LFS related messages
- Check the health endpoint once deployed: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

### 4. **Post-deployment Testing**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Test model status
curl https://your-app.railway.app/model-status

# Test SMS prediction
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/predict-sms/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sms_content": "Free money! Click here now!"}'
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### **Successful Deployment**:
- ‚úÖ Model loads successfully from Git LFS
- ‚úÖ Health check returns `"status": "healthy"`
- ‚úÖ SMS predictions work with AI model
- ‚úÖ `/model-status` shows `"is_loaded": true`

### **Fallback Mode** (if model fails):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Health check returns `"status": "degraded"`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SMS predictions use heuristic method
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `/model-status` shows `"fallback_mode": true`
- ‚úÖ Application still functions correctly

### **Complete Failure** (should not happen):
- ‚ùå Health check fails
- ‚ùå Application doesn't start

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Model Loading Fails:
1. Check `/model-status` endpoint for detailed error information
2. Verify model file size: should be ~518MB
3. Check Git LFS status: `git lfs ls-files`
4. Manually trigger Git LFS pull: `git lfs pull`

### If Build Fails:
1. Check for memory/timeout issues in Railway logs
2. Verify all dependencies are correctly specified
3. Check Docker build context size

### If Health Check Fails:
1. Check model loading errors in application logs
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test individual endpoints (`/ping`, `/model-status`)

## üéâ Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Robust Deployment**: Application will start successfully even if model loading fails
2. **Fast Recovery**: Automatic Git LFS pull attempts and file verification
3. **Better Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and status endpoints
4. **Optimized Performance**: CPU-only dependencies and proper environment variables
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mode ensures core functionality always works
6. **Railway Compatibility**: Optimized for Railway's free plan limitations

Your Fraud Detection API should now deploy successfully on Railway and handle model loading issues gracefully!
