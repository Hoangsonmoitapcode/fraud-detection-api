🚀 STRATEGY 1: Cloud Model Storage

1. Upload 518MB model to cloud:
   - GitHub Releases (free, public)
   - Google Drive (with direct download link)
   - AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage
   - Railway Volume (persistent storage)

2. App downloads on first startup:
   - Fast subsequent startups (cached)
   - No Docker image bloat
   - Easy model updates

Example implementation in src/model_downloader.py

# Strategy 2: Model splitting
print("""
🚀 STRATEGY 2: Model Splitting

1. Split large model into smaller chunks
2. Download in parallel
3. Reassemble at runtime
4. Better download reliability
""")

# Strategy 3: Railway Volume
print("""
🚀 STRATEGY 3: Railway Persistent Volume

1. Create Railway Volume (persistent disk)
2. Download model to volume once
3. Mount volume to all deployments
4. Model persists across deployments

Commands:
railway volume create models
railway volume mount models /app/models

# Current trade-offs
print("""
📊 CURRENT TRADE-OFFS:

✅ PROS of excluding 518MB:
- Fast builds (2-3 min vs timeout)
- Small image (1GB vs 4GB)
- Fast deployments (30s vs 5-10min)
- No GitHub Actions timeout

⚠️ CONS of excluding 518MB:
- Slower first startup (2-3 min)
- Need internet for model download
- First API request slower

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
Keep current approach for stability.
Add cloud model storage for optimization.
